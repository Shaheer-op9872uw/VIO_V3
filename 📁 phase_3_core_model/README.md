# 🚀 Phase 3: Model Architecture (VIO Core Layers)

Welcome to **Phase 3** of the VIO project. This phase defines the architectural backbone of VIO — building powerful custom deep learning blocks designed to outperform transformers in long-range dependency tasks. This phase is where things start getting serious.

## 🔍 What's Inside?

### `mamba_block.py`
Implements a **Mamba-inspired** sequential layer with a focus on:
- Long-range context handling
- Efficiency over full attention
- Low memory footprint
- Fast inference on longer sequences

### `transformer_block.py`
Includes a **streamlined Transformer block**, used selectively where attention mechanisms are truly beneficial. It contains:
- LayerNorm
- MHA (via `attention.py`)
- Feed-forward network (FFN)
- Residual connections

### `attention.py`
Home of the **Multi-Head Self Attention** logic used in our transformer blocks. Fully compatible with `torch` and designed to be plug-and-play with our custom architecture.

### `model.py`
This is **VIO’s full brain**. It brings everything together:
- Modular integration of Mamba and Transformer blocks
- Sequential or parallel hybrid routing depending on configuration
- Hooks ready for Phase-4 (training loop, loss heads, optimizer setup)
- Custom config support via YAML (integrated from Phase 2)

## 🧠 Why Both Mamba & Transformer?

VIO intelligently merges the best of both worlds:

| 🔸 Feature | 🔹 Transformer | 🔹 Mamba |
|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Local Attention | ✅ Excellent | ⚠️ Moderate |
| Long-Range Memory | ⚠️ Weak | ✅ Excellent |
| Speed on Long Seqs | ❌ Slow | ✅ Fast |
| Memory Usage | ❌ High | ✅ Low |

VIO uses **Mamba blocks for depth and memory retention**, and **Transformer blocks** for cross-token interaction where needed. This **hybrid model** makes VIO *faster, smarter, and more efficient* than either architecture alone.

## 🔗 Connectivity Promise

This phase:
- Fully integrates with the dataset preprocessing pipeline from **Phase 2**
- Exposes all model interfaces for seamless use in **Phase 4 (Training + Inference)**
- Includes reusable blocks for transfer learning and experimentation

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- PyTorch 2.x
- Torch.nn modules
- No external DL dependencies required beyond PyTorch
