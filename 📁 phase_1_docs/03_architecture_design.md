# 🏗️ Architecture Design — VIO v3

## 📐 Design Philosophy

VIO (Vision-Informed Operator) v3 is engineered to surpass transformer limitations by adopting **Mamba-inspired implicit state-space modeling**. Our goal is to achieve **low-latency, high-throughput** inference without sacrificing long-range reasoning.

We avoid attention bottlenecks, opt for minimal GPU memory usage, and structure the model to allow flexible plug-and-play for new vision modules.

## 🧱 High-Level Modules

- `phase_2_preprocessing/`: Handles tokenization, data loading, and YAML-based config management.
- `phase_3_core_model/`: The brain — containing model definition and its modular layers (MambaBlock, TransformerBlock, AttentionBlock).
- `phase_4_training/`: Manages training, evaluation, and inference in a clean, decoupled manner.

## 🧩 Model Structure

Input → Tokenizer → Model (
[
MambaBlock × N,
AttentionBlock × M,
Optional TransformerBlock
]
) → Projection → Output

Edit

Each block type is abstracted as its own file under `core_model/layers/`.

## 🔄 Sequence Processing

- Sequential-style memory handling, inspired by Mamba
- Custom layer normalization techniques (RMSNorm/LayerNorm toggle)
- Position embedding via learned tokens or rotary encoding (configurable)

---

## 🖼️ Optional Vision Plugins (planned)

Modular vision head support:
- `conv2d → flatten → linear projection` (CIFAR, TinyImageNet)
- YOLO-style feature extractor for detection
- Vision embedding → fused with text/token stream

---

## 🛠️ Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Every component swappable via config
- **Readability**: Clean and PyTorchic code structure
- **Performance**: Use of fused ops and Flash-attention when supported

## ✅ Outcome

An architecture that's:
- More efficient than transformers
- Easier to scale and customize
- Ready for vision + text multimodal extensions
