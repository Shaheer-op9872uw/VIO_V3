# 🚀 Implementation Plan — VIO v3

This document outlines the development workflow, milestones, and component responsibilities for building VIO v3 — a modular, Mamba-style sequence model with optional vision capabilities.

Each phase targets a specific development area and is version-controlled for rapid iteration and debug isolation.

## 🧩 Phase Breakdown

### ✅ Phase 1 — Planning & Docs (🗓️ Done / In Progress)
- [x] `README.md`
- [x] `architecture_design.md`
- [x] `model_theory.md`
- [x] `implementation_plan.md`
- [ ] `testing_guidelines.md`
- [ ] Diagrams + visuals (optional)

---

### 🛠️ Phase 2 — Preprocessing Layer
- [ ] Tokenizer class (text)
- [ ] Config system via `yaml` loader
- [ ] Dataset loader wrapper (HuggingFace / custom)
- [ ] Augmentation hooks (if vision planned)
- [ ] Save/load preprocessed token streams

> 📍 Output: clean token stream → fed to core model

---

### 🧠 Phase 3 — Core Model

#### 🔹 Base Blocks
- [x] `MambaBlock`
- [ ] `AttentionBlock` (flash / multihead / simple)
- [ ] `TransformerBlock` (optional fallback)
- [ ] LayerNorm + RMSNorm toggle
- [ ] Positional Encoding (rotary / learnable)

#### 🔹 Main Model
- [ ] `VIOModel` class → stacks block types based on config
- [ ] Configurable block sequencing (e.g., Mamba→Attn→Mamba)
- [ ] Output projection head

---

### 📚 Phase 4 — Training & Evaluation
- [ ] `Trainer` class with clear interface
- [ ] `LossTracker`, `Logger`, `CallbackHandler`
- [ ] Support for:
  - Text classification
  - (Optional) Image classification
  - (Optional) Object detection

> 🔧 Include CLI tool for launching training from `yaml` config.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Evaluation

Planned in `testing_guidelines.md`:
- Unit tests (per block)
- Integration tests (input → output end-to-end)
- Benchmarking script (latency / memory)

---

## 🔌 Optional Plugins (Phase 5+)
- [ ] Vision encoder head
- [ ] YOLO-based object detector
- [ ] Multimodal fusion (token fusion / late fusion)
- [ ] LoRA / QLoRA training support

---

## 🧠 Final Goal

Create a **fully modular**, **lightweight**, and **scalable** Mamba-style model that:
- Beats basic transformers on speed
- Supports text + image tasks
- Is readable, hackable, and usable in research or deployment
