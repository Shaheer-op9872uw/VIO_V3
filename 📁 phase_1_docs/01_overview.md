# 🧠 VIOv3 — Visual Insight Operator v3  
*Building the future of lightweight, high-efficiency vision models.*

## 🔍 What is VIOv3?

**VIOv3 (Visual Insight Operator, version 3)** is a custom neural architecture designed to outperform traditional transformer-based vision models in speed, efficiency, and scalability. Inspired by **Mamba**, VIOv3 leverages continuous-state dynamics with modern attention alternatives to reduce memory usage while boosting token throughput — making it ideal for both edge devices and scalable cloud deployments.

> TL;DR: It's a next-gen vision architecture that breaks the rules of transformers while still dominating their playground.

## 🚀 Key Objectives

- **🦾 Replace ViT/ResNet/ConvNext in specific tasks** with a faster, smaller model.
- **📉 Lower memory + compute footprint** without losing accuracy.
- **⚡ Boost inference speed** using state-space models (SSMs) and recurrent token routing.
- **🔧 Modular design** for integration into larger AI stacks or custom pipelines.

## 🧬 Inspiration & Evolution

- **VIOv1**: Basic CNN-RNN hybrid — poor generalization.
- **VIOv2**: Added token mixing layers + early attention — still bottlenecked.
- **VIOv3**: Ground-up rewrite using a Mamba-inspired state-space core + dynamic path routing.

It borrows ideas from:
- 🔬 **Mamba** (state-space modeling, selective recurrence)
- 🧠 **Perceiver IO** (flexible token routing)
- 🛠️ **ConvNeXt** (modern convolution blocks)
- ⚙️ **TinyViT** (edge efficiency)
